# What is Data Carpentry? <img src="DC_logo_teal_lettering_small.png" height="150px" align="right">

Two day intensive workshops, modeled on Software Carpentry 

Learning objective:
Researchers should be able to retrieve, view, manipulate, analyze and store their and other's data in an open and reproducible way.

- Data Carpentry is focused on data - The workshop introduces one data set at the beginning of the workshop. This data set is used throughout the workshop to teach how to manage and analyze data in an effective and reproducible way.
- Data Carpentry is designed for novices - there are no prerequisites, and no prior knowledge about the tools is assumed.
- Data Carpentry is domain specific by design.

- Preparing data for analysis
- How to organize data and use spreadsheet programs more effectively, but also to recognize their limitations.
- Getting data out of spreadsheets and into tools such as R or Python that allow for reproducible workflows and have more capabilities.
- Using databases, including managing and querying data in SQL.
- Workflows and automating repetitive tasks, in particular using the command line shell and shell scripts.
- Using data and computational resources, in particular publicly available ones such as Amazon, DataDryad and Figshare
- Overall, conducting data science more efficiently, reproducibly and openly
